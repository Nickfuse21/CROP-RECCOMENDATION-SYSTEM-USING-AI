# CROP-RECCOMENDATION-SYSTEM-USING-AI
🌾 Crop Recommendation System

An AI-powered Crop Recommendation System that suggests the most suitable crop based on soil parameters, weather conditions, and historical yield data.
This system leverages machine learning algorithms to help farmers make data-driven decisions, improving productivity and sustainability in agriculture.

📌 Overview

Modern farming faces challenges like unpredictable climate, soil degradation, and water scarcity.
This project uses data science and AI to recommend crops that are best suited for a given set of conditions, thereby reducing risk and increasing profitability.

The system takes soil nutrient values (NPK), temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH level as input, then applies a trained machine learning model to recommend the most optimal crop.

🚀 Features

🌱 Smart Crop Recommendations – Based on real-time soil and climate data.

🤖 ML-Powered Predictions – Uses trained classification models for high accuracy.

📊 Data-Driven Insights – Analyzes past yield patterns for better decision-making.

📉 Risk Reduction – Avoids crop failure due to unsuitable planting conditions.

🌍 Sustainable Agriculture – Promotes optimal resource utilization.
