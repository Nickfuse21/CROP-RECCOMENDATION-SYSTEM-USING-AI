# Crop Recommendation System using AI

This project presents an AI-powered Crop Recommendation System designed to suggest the most suitable crop based on soil characteristics and environmental conditions. The system leverages machine learning techniques to assist farmers and agricultural planners in making data-driven decisions that improve productivity, reduce risk, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Project Overview

Agriculture today faces significant challenges including climate variability, soil degradation, and inefficient resource utilization. Selecting the wrong crop for given soil and weather conditions can result in poor yield and financial loss.

This system addresses that problem by analyzing key soil and climate parameters such as:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rainfall
- Soil pH

Using these inputs, a trained machine learning model predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation under the given conditions.

## System Workflow

1. Soil nutrient and environmental parameters are provided as input.
2. The input data is cleaned and preprocessed.
3. Features are normalized where required.
4. A trained classification model processes the input.
5. The system outputs the most appropriate crop recommendation.
